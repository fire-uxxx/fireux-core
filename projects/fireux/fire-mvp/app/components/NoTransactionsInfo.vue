    <p>
      FIReMVP is provided by ðŸ”¥FIReUX as a low-code solution for developers
      who want to integrate Stripe and Firebase quickly. By cloning the
      project from GitHub and updating your API keys and configuration
      details, youâ€™ll have a fully functional tipping system that allows
      users to send a one-dollar tip directly into your Stripe account.

      This project is fully customizable and serves as the foundation for
      all our subsequent applications and tutorials. With FIReMVP, you learn
      how to manage transactions and maintain a databaseâ€”skills that unlock
      the potential to build a wide range of online applications.
