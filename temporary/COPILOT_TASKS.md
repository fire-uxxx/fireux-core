üõ†Ô∏è Copilot Task: Prevent Yarn workspace autobuild errors

For each workspace under `projects/**/package.json`, locate the `"scripts"` section and append:

  "prepare": "echo 'workspace build no-op'"

So that it looks like:

```jsonc
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt dev",
  "build": "nuxt build",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "prepare": "echo 'workspace build no-op'"
}
```

This stub prepare ensures that when you run `yarn install`, Yarn‚Äôs workspace autobuild sees a valid prepare step and does nothing (echo 'workspace build no-op') instead of trying your real build and failing. Once applied, delete all node_modules and any sub-package yarn.lock files, then run `yarn install` at the root and the install/link phase will complete cleanly.
-->

### What that ‚Äúno-op prepare‚Äù does

- **Yarn Workspaces autobuild**: by default, Yarn will run each workspace‚Äôs `prepare` (or `build`) script during `yarn install` so that packages are ready for consumption.
- **Your real apps don‚Äôt need a build step right now** during install ‚Äî you only build them in CI or via `yarn workspace <app> build`.
- **By echoing a no-op**, you satisfy Yarn‚Äôs requirement to run something, but it immediately exits successfully, preventing the ‚Äúmust be built‚Äù errors.
- **As soon as you want a proper build**, just replace or augment that stub `prepare` with your real build command.

### Development Checklist for Nuxt Modules

When developing a Nuxt module, always ensure the following steps are completed:

1. **Prepare Script**:

   - Add a `prepare` script in the `package.json` file to handle build and preparation steps.
   - Example:
     ```json
     "prepare": "nuxt-module-build build --stub && nuxt-module-build prepare"
     ```

2. **Vite Configuration**:

   - Use the `vite:extendConfig` hook to extend `vite.server.fs.allow` for monorepo compatibility.
   - Include paths for the module, monorepo root, and `node_modules` directories.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     nuxt.hook("vite:extendConfig", (viteConfig) => {
       viteConfig.server ||= {};
       viteConfig.server.fs ||= {};
       viteConfig.server.fs.allow ||= [];

       viteConfig.server.fs.allow.push(
         __dirname, // this module
         resolve(__dirname, "../../.."), // monorepo root
         resolve(__dirname, "../../node_modules"), // hoisted deps
         resolve(__dirname, "../../../node_modules") // monorepo node_modules
       );
     });
     ```

3. **Testing**:

   - Run the `prepare` script before testing the module in dependent projects.
   - Start the development server and verify functionality.

4. **Logging**:

   - Add logging to debug configuration issues during development.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the `README.md` file with instructions for setting up and using the module.
